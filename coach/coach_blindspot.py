"""Living Claude Tutor - P8 quarterly blind-spot pass (SPEC.html piece P8).
The weekly loop normalizes its own blind spots: whatever it consistently overlooks
becomes invisible to it. Quarterly, audit the TUTOR ITSELF - not the user:
assemble an aggregates-only package (TUTOR-MODEL.md + rules.json + last 4 weekly
snapshots) -> one Sonnet call asking "what does this model of the user NOT see?"
-> findings to reports/, proposals to pending-proposals.json. Human-approved, as ever.

Usage: python tutor_blindspot.py [--no-llm]
--no-llm still writes the input package (reports/blindspot-input-<Q>.md) so you can
run the interactive blind-spot-pass skill on it by hand instead. Stdlib only.

ITS LAST %d WEEKLY SNAPSHOTS (every metric it knows how to compute):

Work through, in order:
1. STACK MAP: sketch the full space of Claude Code cost/quality waste (context, prompting, tooling,
   orchestration, config, cross-session, model choice). Mark each region COVERED or BLIND given the
   metrics above.
2. MEASUREMENT ARTIFACTS: what does the tutor systematically miss BECAUSE of how it measures?
   (streaming counters, weekly aggregation, main-transcripts-only, threshold framing, survivorship.)
3. STALE BELIEFS: which entries in the model/rules look wrong, outdated, or never re-validated?
4. RAT-HOLES: where could the tutor waste effort on metrics that sound useful but change no behavior?
5. HIGH-YIELD UNASKED QUESTIONS: the 3 questions this audit should ask next quarter, each with a
   concretely computable sensor spec (from transcript JSONL, stdlib only).

Then ONE fenced ```json block:
